					<img class="drop-img" src="riperian.jpg"> 
                    <p>Riparian Strips are a great way to take care of your land. By planting trees and wetland shrubs, you can help nature do its job of filtering waterways and provide safe habitat for native flora and fauna. There is a lot of department help in this area, and we would be happy to put you in contact, as well as work with our plant experts to source the right trees for your unique wetland area.</p>

					<img class="drop-img" src="sheltrebelt.jpg"> 
                    <p>With developing weather conditions, establishing a strong shelter belt can be a great idea. This requires strong upright plants that can take the force of a powerful cold wind. Ensuring this is planted right for maximum protection is crucial for a functional shelter belt. This can be complex with power lines or even if you want to keep an eye on stock from the kitchen window, but with our AI imaging tools, we can ensure that the perfect trees are planted for that project.</p>

                    <p>Trees can last for a very long time, and planting something garish that the wife’s going to give you grief about for the next 50 years might not be the best of ideas. With our AI imaging, however, we can provide you with a window to the future so that you can see how it will look, and more importantly, how it will look compared to the surroundings. We can also work with you to make sure that we get plants to the right height if you still want to see some stunning mountains in the back or keep an eye out for the postie up the road.</p>

                <div class="dropdown">
					<img class="drop-img" src="reforestation.jpg"> 
                    <p>Native tree reforestation is a movement that is gaining more support from government departments, but it is also a job that sorely needs to be done. If you have some low-yield land, converting it back to native bush can be a great way to beautify the land and help New Zealand’s unique native flora and fauna. We can work with nurseries to bring a diverse range of native trees and plants to bring back a little slice of original paradise. Depending on the size of the project, we can also potentially get some supplementary funding from the government and set you up for carbon crediting, transforming that land into not only a beautiful piece of native forest but also making it financially rewarding for you in the long run. Yes, money can grow off trees.</p>

                <h3>About our ai simulation technology ▼</h3>
                <div class="dropdown">
					 
                    <p>With the help of AI tools, we are able to take photos of the project site and then develop a realistic view of how the project will look, with the trees you want to see. This is a powerful tool, as it means you get an idea of what it will look like and whether you want to proceed or not. We can also make adjustments to the types of plants if they do not match your vision.</p>
					
				
					
					<li> <h2> Before</h2> <img src="before.png"  class="float-image"> When we come out to visit you, we can take an image of the project, which is useful for estimating the number of trees required for the project and identifying size requirements. For landscape features, we can also ensure to capture the surroundings of the project if you wish the final product to be contrasting/complimentary in colour/texture to the surrounding environment.</li>
					<li> <h2> After </h2> <img src="after.png" class="float-image"> Using AI simulation technology, we can show you a realistic depiction of how the project will look. This allows you to visualise what it will be like 5-10 years down the road. Additionally, if you are not satisfied with the look of the project, we can play around with the spacing and types of trees to ensure that we create the project you want to see. We can also factor in the full height of the plants fully grown, as well as spread, in order to avoid shading, obscuring views, or other size-related issues. </li>
					<li><h2> Forever</h2> <img src="forever.jpg" class="float-image"> Partnering with Resolution Farming, we are able to keep a record of the trees that were planted on your site, as well as long-term survival rates. We can also, with your approval, keep track of soil type, moisture, and species type. This information can be used to help you with your farm plan, which we would be happy to assist you with. It also allows us to gather a more in-depth understanding of the intricacies of the process, refining and ever improving our service. None of the personal information we collect is distributed or shared, and if you prefer, we can refrain from collecting personal identifiers. </li>

				 <h2 class="sub-titel">About Us:</h2>
				<img src="us.jpg" class="float-image us">
				<p>Treet Yourself is a Young Enterprise Company co-run by Caleb Diprose and Brodie Murdoch. We are both Southland-born and raised farm lads, and proudly so. Our objective is to provide a farmer-friendly tree planting service that allows you, the customer, to focus on more pressing issues while we take care of the time-intensive tree planting/maintenance aspect. We work with local nurseries and tree experts to achieve this and have a crew of hardworking and competent contractors to help. We started in 2023 as a school project at Aparima College, however, with the support of our community, mentors, and Young Enterprise, we have launched into a fully-fledged company and will continue to run after we leave Young Enterprise and school. This company has really opened our eyes to the need for tree planters, as farmers have time limitations, and policymakers don’t want to mandate tree plantings. We can cut through the red tape and provide the solution for both parties.</p>
